# Asterisk AI Voice Agent v3.0

An open-source AI Voice Agent that integrates with Asterisk/FreePBX using the Asterisk REST Interface (ARI). It features a **production-ready, two-container architecture** with **Hybrid ARI** call control, **SessionStore** state management, ExternalMedia RTP integration for reliable real-time audio capture and file-based TTS playback for robust conversation handling.

## 🌟 Why Asterisk AI Voice Agent?

This project is designed to be the most powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source AI voice agent for Asterisk. Here’s what makes it different:

*   **Asterisk-Native:** No external telephony providers required. It works directly with your existing Asterisk/FreePBX installation.
*   **Truly Open Source:** The entire project is open source (MIT licensed), so you have complete transparency and control.
*   **Hybrid AI:** Seamlessly switch between cloud and local AI providers, giving you the best of both worlds.
*   **Production-Ready:** This isn’t just a demo. It’s a battle-tested, production-ready solution.
*   **Cost-Effective:** With local AI, you can have predictable costs without per-minute charges.

## ✨ Features

- **Modular AI Providers**: Easily switch between cloud and local AI providers.
  - ✅ **Deepgram Voice Agent**: Fully implemented for a powerful cloud-based solution.
  - ✅ **OpenAI Realtime**: Works out of the box—just set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` and select the OpenAI template/provider.
  - ✅ **Local AI Server**: A dedicated container that runs local models (Vosk for STT, Llama for LLM, and Piper for TTS) for full control and privacy.
- **High-Performance Architecture**: A lean `ai-engine` for call control and a separate `local-ai-server` for heavy AI processing ensures stability and scalability.
- **Hybrid ARI Architecture**: Call control using ARI with "answer caller → create mixing bridge → add caller → create ExternalMedia and add it to bridge" flow.
- **SessionStore State Management**: Centralized, typed store for all call session state, replacing legacy dictionary-based state management.
- **Real-time Communication**: ExternalMedia RTP upstream capture from Asterisk with ARI-commanded file-based playback; engine↔AI servers use WebSocket.
- **Docker-based Deployment**: Simple, two-service orchestration using Docker Compose.
- **Customizable**: Configure greetings, AI roles, and voice personalities in a simple YAML file.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these 3 steps to get a working agent.

1) Clone and install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hkjarral/Asterisk-AI-Voice-Agent.git
cd Asterisk-AI-Voice-Agent
./install.sh
```
When prompted, choose your preferred configuration. The installer will:
- Create/update `.env` (prefilled from existing values on reruns; blank keeps current).
- Write `config/ai-agent.yaml` from the canonical pipelines template and set your selection as the active default (pipeline or monolithic provider).
- Set up the media path symlink.
- Start only what is required for your selection:
  - Local/Hybrid: start `local-ai-server` (wait for health), then `ai-engine`.
  - Cloud-only/Monolithic: start `ai-engine` only.

2) Verify health
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:15000/health
```
Expect `"audiosocket_listening": true`.

3) FreePBX dialplan (AudioSocket-first)
Add the context from `docs/FreePBX-Integration-Guide.md` (`from-ai-agent`, etc.), then route a test call to it.

Hello World (optional, Local AI):
```bash
python3 tests/test_local_ai_server_protocol.py  # With local-ai-server running
```
#### OpenAI Realtime quick start (cloud-only)

If you want to use OpenAI Realtime out of the box:

1) During `./install.sh`, select the OpenAI Realtime option when prompted (the installer keeps the pipelines template and sets `default_provider` to OpenAI Realtime for monolithic operation).
2) Add your API key in `.env`:
   ```bash
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." >> .env
   ```
3) Start just the engine (no local models needed):
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d ai-engine
    ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The system is configured via `config/ai-agent.yaml` and a `.env` file for secrets.
The installer is idempotent and pipeline-aware. It always writes `config/ai-agent.yaml` from the canonical pipelines template and then:
- Sets `active_pipeline` for Local/Hybrid/Cloud-OpenAI choices.
- Sets `default_provider` for monolithic choices (OpenAI Realtime or Deepgram).
- Updates `llm.initial_greeting` and `llm.prompt` via `yq` when available, with a safe append fallback otherwise.
### Canonical persona and greeting
- The canonical source for the agent greeting and persona lives in `config/ai-agent.yaml` under the `llm` block:
  - `llm.initial_greeting`
  - `llm.prompt`
- Precedence rules at runtime:
  1) Provider or pipeline-specific overrides (e.g., `providers.openai_realtime.instructions` or `providers.deepgram.greeting`) if explicitly set
  2) `llm.prompt` and `llm.initial_greeting` in YAML
  3) Environment variables `AI_ROLE` and `GREETING` as defaults

This ensures all providers and pipelines stay aligned unless you intentionally override them per provider/pipeline.

### Installer behavior (idempotent and pipeline-aware)

- [`./install.sh`](install.sh) prompts for ARI credentials, API keys, Greeting, and AI Role.
  - All prompts are prefilled from `.env` on reruns; leaving a field blank keeps its existing value.
- The installer always writes `config/ai-agent.yaml` from the canonical pipelines template and then:
  - Sets `active_pipeline` for Local/Hybrid/Cloud-OpenAI choices.
  - Sets `default_provider` for monolithic choices (OpenAI Realtime or Deepgram).
- It updates `llm.initial_greeting` and `llm.prompt` via `yq` when available, with a safe append fallback otherwise.
- `${VAR}` placeholders in YAML remain supported; the loader expands these at runtime.
- Service startup is selection-aware:
  - Local/Hybrid: `local-ai-server` is started first and waited on, then `ai-engine`.
  - Cloud-only/Monolithic: only `ai-engine` is started.

### Key `ai-agent.yaml` settings:
- `default_provider`: `openai_realtime` (monolithic fallback; pipelines are the default path via `active_pipeline`)
- `asterisk`: Connection details for ARI.
- `providers`: Specific configurations for each AI provider.

For a full, option-by-option reference (with recommended ranges and impact), see [`docs/Configuration-Reference.md`](docs/Configuration-Reference.md). For practical presets, see [`docs/Tuning-Recipes.md`](docs/Tuning-Recipes.md).

### Required `.env` variables:
- `ASTERISK_ARI_USERNAME` & `ASTERISK_ARI_PASSWORD`
- `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` (if using Deepgram)

### Optional local AI tuning (set via environment variables)
- `LOCAL_LLM_MODEL_PATH`: absolute path to an alternative GGUF file mounted into the container.
- `LOCAL_LLM_MAX_TOKENS`: cap the number of response tokens (default `48` for faster replies).
- `LOCAL_LLM_TEMPERATURE`, `LOCAL_LLM_TOP_P`, `LOCAL_LLM_REPEAT_PENALTY`: sampling controls for the TinyLlama runtime.
- `LOCAL_LLM_THREADS`, `LOCAL_LLM_CONTEXT`, `LOCAL_LLM_BATCH`: advanced performance knobs; defaults auto-detect CPU cores and favour latency.
- `LOCAL_STT_MODEL_PATH`, `LOCAL_TTS_MODEL_PATH`: override default Vosk/Piper models if you preload alternates under `models/`.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The application is split into two Docker containers for performance and scalability:

1.  **`ai-engine`**: A lightweight service that connects to Asterisk via ARI, manages the call lifecycle, and communicates with AI providers.
2.  **`local-ai-server`**: A dedicated, powerful service that pre-loads and runs local STT, LLM, and TTS models, exposing them via a WebSocket interface.

```
┌─────────────────┐      ┌───────────┐      ┌───────────────────┐
│ Asterisk Server │◀────▶│ ai-engine │◀────▶│ AI Provider       │
│ (ARI, RTP)      │      │ (Docker)  │      │ (Deepgram, etc.)  │
└─────────────────┘      └───────────┘      └───────────────────┘
                           │     ▲
                           │ WSS │ WebSocket
                           ▼     │
                         ┌─────────────────┐
                         │ local-ai-server │
                         │ (Docker)        │
                         └─────────────────┘
```

This separation ensures that the resource-intensive AI models do not impact the real-time call handling performance of the `ai-engine`. The system uses ExternalMedia RTP for reliable audio capture and file-based TTS playback for robust conversation handling. Streaming TTS is planned as a future enhancement.
