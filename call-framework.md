**AI Engine Logs:**
```
# No RTP audio received logs found
# No SSRC mapping logs found
# No voice capture processing logs found
```

**Status**: ‚ùå **FAILURE** - No RTP audio received from caller

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **‚úÖ Race Condition FIXED (RESOLVED)**
**Problem**: `active_calls` wasn't initialized before ExternalMedia channel creation
**Impact**: ExternalMedia channel couldn't find its caller
**Evidence**: Previous logs showed "ExternalMedia channel entered Stasis but no caller found"
**Solution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - "Initialized active_calls for caller" now appears in logs

### 2. **‚úÖ ExternalMedia Channel Mapping FIXED (RESOLVED)**
**Problem**: Data structure mismatch in mapping logic
**Impact**: ExternalMedia channel couldn't be added to bridge
**Evidence**: Previous logs showed mapping failures
**Solution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - "ExternalMedia channel added to bridge" now appears in logs

### 3. **‚úÖ Provider Session Working (RESOLVED)**
**Problem**: Provider session never started due to mapping failures
**Impact**: No greeting played, no voice capture
**Evidence**: Previous logs showed no TTS or provider activity
**Solution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Provider session now starts and TTS works perfectly

### 4. **‚ùå RTP Audio Not Received (NEW ISSUE)**
**Problem**: No RTP packets received from Asterisk to our RTP server
**Impact**: No voice capture possible despite audio capture being enabled
**Evidence**: No RTP/SSRC logs found in engine logs
**Root Cause**: Asterisk not sending RTP packets to our RTP server (127.0.0.1:18080)

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue #1: ‚úÖ Data Structure Mismatch FIXED (RESOLVED)
**Previous**: ExternalMedia handler looked in `caller_channels` for mapping
**Fixed**: Now looks in `active_calls` where the data is actually stored
**Impact**: ‚úÖ ExternalMedia channels can now find their caller channels

### Issue #2: ‚úÖ Missing Bridge Addition FIXED (RESOLVED)
**Previous**: ExternalMedia channel not added to bridge
**Fixed**: ExternalMedia channel now added to bridge after successful mapping
**Impact**: ‚úÖ Audio path established between caller and ExternalMedia

### Issue #3: ‚úÖ No Provider Session FIXED (RESOLVED)
**Previous**: Provider session never started
**Fixed**: Provider session now starts after successful bridge addition
**Impact**: ‚úÖ Greeting plays successfully, TTS works perfectly

### Issue #4: ‚ùå RTP Audio Not Received (NEW - CRITICAL)
**Current**: No RTP packets received from Asterisk to our RTP server
**Required**: Asterisk must send RTP packets to 127.0.0.1:18080
**Impact**: No voice capture possible despite all other components working

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix #1: ‚úÖ Data Structure Mapping FIXED (COMPLETED)
**Problem**: ExternalMedia handler used wrong data structure
**Solution**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Changed mapping logic to use `active_calls` instead of `caller_channels`
**Result**: ExternalMedia channels can now find their caller channels

### Fix #2: ‚úÖ Bridge Addition FIXED (COMPLETED)
**Problem**: ExternalMedia channel not added to bridge
**Solution**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Bridge addition now happens after successful mapping
**Result**: Audio path established between caller and ExternalMedia

### Fix #3: ‚úÖ Provider Session FIXED (COMPLETED)
**Problem**: Provider session never started
**Solution**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Provider session now starts after successful bridge addition
**Result**: Greeting plays successfully, TTS works perfectly

### Fix #4: ‚ùå RTP Audio Reception (NEW - CRITICAL)
**Problem**: No RTP packets received from Asterisk to our RTP server
**Solution**: Investigate why Asterisk is not sending RTP packets to 127.0.0.1:18080
**Possible Causes**:
- ExternalMedia channel configuration issue
- RTP server binding issue
- Network connectivity issue
- Asterisk RTP routing configuration

## Confidence Score: 9/10

The major architectural issues have been resolved. The ExternalMedia + RTP approach is working correctly for outbound audio (greeting). The remaining issue is inbound audio capture (RTP reception), which is a configuration/networking issue rather than a code logic issue.

## Next Steps

1. **‚úÖ Data structure mapping** - COMPLETED
2. **‚úÖ Bridge addition** - COMPLETED  
3. **‚úÖ Provider session** - COMPLETED
4. **‚ùå RTP audio reception** - Investigate why Asterisk not sending RTP packets
5. **Test complete two-way audio** - Verify end-to-end conversation flow

{"channel_id": "1758100747.5950", "event": "üé§ AUDIO CAPTURE - No connection found for channel"}
```

**Status**: ‚ùå **FAILURE** - No AudioSocket connection available for voice capture (404 error prevented connection)

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **AudioSocket ARI Command 404 Error (CRITICAL)**
**Problem**: ARI execute_application returns 404 error for AudioSocket command
**Impact**: No AudioSocket connection established, no voice capture possible
**Evidence**: `{"status": 404, "reason": "{\"message\":\"Resource not found\"}"}`
**Root Cause**: AudioSocket is not supported via ARI execute_application in Asterisk 16

### 2. **Garbled Greeting Audio (NEW ISSUE)**
**Problem**: Greeting plays but sounds distorted/garbled
**Impact**: Poor user experience, unclear what's being said
**Evidence**: User reported "garbled initial greeting"
**Possible Cause**: Audio format mismatch or codec issue

### 3. **Missing AudioSocket Connection Mapping**
**Problem**: No connection ID available for voice capture after greeting
**Impact**: Voice capture cannot be enabled
**Evidence**: `"üé§ AUDIO CAPTURE - No connection found for channel"`

### 4. **‚úÖ TTS Generation Working**
**Problem**: Previously broken, now fixed
**Impact**: Greeting audio generated successfully
**Evidence**: `"TTS response received and delivered"` + 13,003 bytes generated

### 5. **‚úÖ ARI File Playback Working**
**Problem**: Previously broken, now working
**Impact**: Audio plays to caller successfully
**Evidence**: `"Audio playback initiated successfully"` + `"Initial greeting played via ARI"`

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue #1: AudioSocket ARI Command 404 Error (CRITICAL)
**Current**: `execute_application` returns 404 for AudioSocket command
**Required**: Use dialplan approach instead of ARI command (AudioSocket not supported via ARI)

### Issue #2: Garbled Greeting Audio (NEW - HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current**: Greeting plays but sounds distorted
**Required**: Investigate audio format/codec mismatch causing distortion

### Issue #3: Missing AudioSocket Connection Mapping
**Current**: No connection ID available for voice capture
**Required**: Establish AudioSocket connection via dialplan and map to channel

### Issue #4: ‚úÖ TTS Generation Fixed
**Current**: Working correctly
**Required**: No action needed

### Issue #5: ‚úÖ ARI File Playback Fixed
**Current**: Working correctly
**Required**: No action needed

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix #1: Implement Dialplan AudioSocket Approach (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: ARI execute_application returns 404 for AudioSocket
**Solution**: Use dialplan approach - originate Local channel directly to AudioSocket context
```asterisk
[ai-audiosocket-only]
exten => _[0-9a-fA-F].,1,NoOp(AudioSocket for ${EXTEN})
 same => n,Answer()
 same => n,AudioSocket(${EXTEN},127.0.0.1:8090)
 same => n,Hangup()
```

### Fix #2: Investigate Garbled Audio (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Greeting plays but sounds distorted
**Solution**: Check audio format/codec compatibility between TTS output and Asterisk playback

### Fix #3: Verify AudioSocket Connection Mapping
**Problem**: No connection established for voice capture
**Solution**: Ensure AudioSocket connection is properly mapped to channel after dialplan approach

### Fix #4: Test Complete Two-Way Audio
**Problem**: Only outbound audio working
**Solution**: Verify inbound audio capture and processing after AudioSocket fix

### Fix #5: ‚úÖ TTS and Playback Working
**Status**: No action needed - working correctly

## Confidence Score: 8/10

The analysis shows that the major infrastructure is working (TTS, ARI playback, Stasis, Bridge) but two critical issues remain: AudioSocket connection establishment failing due to ARI command 404 error, and garbled greeting audio. The solution is to use dialplan approach instead of ARI execute_application.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix AudioSocket connection** - Use dialplan approach instead of ARI command
2. **Investigate garbled audio** - Check audio format/codec compatibility
3. **Test voice capture** - Verify AudioSocket connection and voice processing
4. **Test complete two-way audio** - Verify end-to-end conversation flow
5. **‚úÖ TTS and playback working** - No action needed
