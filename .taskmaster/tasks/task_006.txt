# Task ID: 6
# Title: Optimize Performance and Add Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations to meet PRD targets and add comprehensive monitoring and health checking
# Details:
Optimize the system to meet all PRD performance targets: <2 seconds for AI responses, <500ms audio latency, <2GB memory usage, <80% CPU usage, 99.5% uptime. Implement comprehensive logging system for troubleshooting. Add health checks and status reporting dashboard. Create monitoring for response times, resource usage, and service availability. Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms. Add metrics collection for call success rates, conversation quality, and system performance. Optimize audio streaming and processing pipeline for minimal latency. Implement resource pooling and caching where appropriate.

# Test Strategy:
Load test the system under various scenarios. Benchmark response times and resource usage. Test monitoring and alerting systems. Verify health checks detect issues correctly. Test system recovery after failures. Validate performance metrics meet all PRD targets under realistic call loads.
