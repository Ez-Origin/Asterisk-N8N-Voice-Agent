			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the existing pytest-asyncio test infrastructure by: 1) Adding comprehensive test fixtures for rtpengine and enhanced ARI mocking, 2) Implementing missing barge-in scenario tests with interrupt simulation, 3) Creating load testing with pytest-xdist for concurrent call handling, 4) Expanding error scenario coverage beyond current resilience tests, 5) Adding performance benchmarking tests for STT/LLM/TTS latency targets, 6) Achieving 80%+ test coverage across all critical service interaction paths",
			"reasoning": "Complexity reduced from 8 to 6 because the project already has solid pytest infrastructure, working Redis fixtures, basic integration tests, and docker-compose.test.yml setup. The existing test structure in tests/integration/ and tests/resilience/ provides a good foundation. Main work needed is expanding coverage and adding performance/load testing capabilities."

			"taskTitle": "Update Documentation and Deployment Guide",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build upon existing README.md and docs structure by: 1) Updating README.md to reflect the current microservices architecture and remove outdated SIP references, 2) Creating detailed migration guide from the legacy monolithic structure to current ARI-based services, 3) Documenting all service configuration options and environment variables beyond the basic ones listed, 4) Adding architecture diagrams and service interaction flows using the existing service structure, 5) Creating operational runbooks covering the implemented monitoring and health check systems",
			"reasoning": "Complexity reduced from 7 to 4 because the project already has a well-structured README.md with good documentation practices, existing docs/ folder, and clear project organization. The microservices architecture is implemented and running, so documentation mainly needs updates rather than creation from scratch. The existing structure provides a solid foundation to build upon."
