# ExternalMedia + RTP Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the deployment and testing of the ExternalMedia + RTP implementation for the Asterisk AI Voice Agent. This implementation replaces AudioSocket with ARI ExternalMedia for more reliable audio capture.

## Architecture

- **Upstream**: Caller audio â†’ ARI ExternalMedia â†’ RTP â†’ Engine â†’ Provider
- **Downstream**: Provider TTS â†’ File-based playback â†’ ARI â†’ Caller
- **Transport**: UDP RTP on port 18080 (configurable)
- **Codec**: Âµ-law (8kHz) with automatic resampling to PCM16k (16kHz)

## Configuration

### YAML Configuration

The configuration is automatically set in `config/ai-agent.yaml`:

```yaml
audio_transport: "externalmedia"

external_media:
  rtp_host: "0.0.0.0"        # bind inside container
  rtp_port: 18080            # fixed port for simplicity
  codec: "ulaw"              # ulaw (8k) or slin16 (8k)
  direction: "both"          # sendrecv | sendonly | recvonly
  jitter_buffer_ms: 20       # target frame size
```

### Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your `.env` file:

```bash
ASTERISK_HOST=127.0.0.1
ASTERISK_ARI_USERNAME=your_ari_username
ASTERISK_ARI_PASSWORD=your_ari_password
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Validation

Run the validation script to ensure everything is ready:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_externalmedia_config.py
```

Expected output:
```
ðŸŽ‰ All validations passed! Ready for deployment.
```

### 2. Deploy to Server

Use the Makefile for deployment:

```bash
# For code changes (recommended)
make deploy

# For dependency changes or cache issues
make deploy-force
```

### 3. Verify Deployment

Check that the engine starts successfully:

```bash
make server-logs
```

Expected logs:
```
âœ… Successfully connected to ARI HTTP endpoint
âœ… Successfully connected to ARI WebSocket
âœ… RTP server listening on udp://0.0.0.0:18080
âœ… Engine started and listening for calls
```

## Testing

### Test Call Checklist

When placing a test call, monitor these logs:

#### 1. Call Initiation
- âœ… "StasisStart event received"
- âœ… "Caller channel entered Stasis"
- âœ… "Caller channel answered"

#### 2. Bridge Creation
- âœ… "Bridge created"
- âœ… "Caller added to bridge"

#### 3. ExternalMedia Channel
- âœ… "Creating ExternalMedia channel"
- âœ… "ExternalMedia channel created successfully"
- âœ… "ExternalMedia channel added to bridge"

#### 4. Provider Session
- âœ… "Provider session started for ExternalMedia"
- âœ… "Greeting playback started for ExternalMedia"

#### 5. RTP Audio Capture
- âœ… "RTP audio received" (when you speak)
- âœ… "RTP audio sent to provider"

#### 6. Provider Response
- âœ… "Audio playback initiated successfully"

### Troubleshooting

#### No RTP Received
- **Check**: Asterisk can reach `127.0.0.1:18080`
- **Verify**: Host networking is enabled in docker-compose.yml
- **Confirm**: RTP server is listening on the correct port

#### Garbled Audio
- **Check**: Codec consistency (`ulaw` vs `slin16`)
- **Verify**: Only one resample step (8kâ†’16k)
- **Confirm**: Audio format matches between Asterisk and RTP server

#### ExternalMedia Channel Creation Fails
- **Check**: ARI credentials are correct
- **Verify**: Asterisk has ExternalMedia support
- **Confirm**: Network connectivity between containers

#### No Voice Capture After Greeting
- **Check**: `audio_capture_enabled` flag is set after greeting
- **Verify**: RTP packets are being received
- **Confirm**: Provider is processing audio correctly

## Monitoring

### Health Endpoint

The engine exposes a health endpoint at `http://localhost:15000/health`:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "ari_connected": true,
  "audiosocket_listening": false,
  "rtp_server_running": true,
  "active_calls": 0,
  "providers": {
    "local": "ready"
  }
}
```

### RTP Server Stats

Access RTP server statistics via the engine logs or health endpoint:

```json
{
  "running": true,
  "host": "0.0.0.0",
  "port": 18080,
  "codec": "ulaw",
  "total_sessions": 1,
  "active_sessions": 1,
  "total_frames_received": 150,
  "total_frames_processed": 150,
  "total_packet_loss": 0,
  "ssrc_mappings": 1
}
```

## Fallback Strategy

If ExternalMedia fails, you can fallback to AudioSocket by changing the configuration:

```yaml
audio_transport: "audiosocket"
```

This will use the existing AudioSocket implementation as a fallback.

## Performance Expectations

- **Latency**: P95 < 2 seconds end-to-end
- **Audio Quality**: Clear voice capture and playback
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and recovery
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple concurrent calls

## Next Steps

### Phase 6: Operations (Future)

- Health monitoring dashboard
- Metrics collection and alerting
- Automated testing and validation
- Performance optimization

### Future Enhancements

- Downstream RTP streaming (optional)
- Barge-in support during playback
- Advanced jitter buffering
- Telemetry and analytics

## Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check the logs using `make server-logs`
2. Run validation script: `python3 scripts/validate_externalmedia_config.py`
3. Verify configuration matches this guide
4. Check Asterisk logs for ExternalMedia errors

## Success Criteria

A successful deployment should show:

1. âœ… Engine starts without errors
2. âœ… RTP server listening on port 18080
3. âœ… ExternalMedia channels created successfully
4. âœ… Voice capture works after greeting
5. âœ… Provider responses are heard clearly
6. âœ… No audio quality issues
7. âœ… Clean call termination

If all criteria are met, the ExternalMedia + RTP implementation is working correctly!
