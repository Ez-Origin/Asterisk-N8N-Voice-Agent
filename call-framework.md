## Call Timeline Analysis

### Phase 1: Call Initiation (12:00:38)
**AI Engine Logs:**
```
{"channel_id": "1758135631.6020", "event": "üéØ HYBRID ARI - StasisStart event received"}
{"channel_id": "1758135631.6020", "event": "üéØ HYBRID ARI - Step 2: Creating bridge immediately"}
{"bridge_id": "9b15a5cb-86d3-4f0a-908d-05721df96af1", "event": "Bridge created"}
{"channel_id": "1758135631.6020", "event": "üéØ HYBRID ARI - Step 3: ‚úÖ Caller added to bridge"}
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESS** - Caller entered Stasis, bridge created, caller added

### Phase 2: ExternalMedia Channel Creation (12:00:39)
**AI Engine Logs:**
```
{"channel_id": "1758135631.6020", "event": "üéØ EXTERNAL MEDIA - Step 5: Creating ExternalMedia channel"}
{"caller_channel_id": "1758135631.6020", "external_media_id": "1758135639.6021", "event": "ExternalMedia channel created successfully"}
{"channel_id": "1758135639.6021", "event": "üéØ EXTERNAL MEDIA - ExternalMedia channel created, waiting for StasisStart"}
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESS** - ExternalMedia channel created successfully

### Phase 3: ExternalMedia StasisStart Event (12:00:39)
**AI Engine Logs:**
```
{"channel_id": "1758135639.6021", "event": "üéØ EXTERNAL MEDIA - ExternalMedia channel entered Stasis"}
{"external_media_id": "1758135639.6021", "event": "ExternalMedia channel entered Stasis but no caller found"}
```

**Status**: ‚ùå **FAILURE** - Channel mapping failed, no caller found

### Phase 4: Bridge Addition (MISSING)
**AI Engine Logs:**
```
# No logs for bridge addition - ExternalMedia channel never added to bridge
```

**Status**: ‚ùå **FAILURE** - ExternalMedia channel not added to bridge

### Phase 5: Provider Session (MISSING)
**AI Engine Logs:**
```
# No logs for provider session - never started due to mapping failure
```

**Status**: ‚ùå **FAILURE** - No greeting played, no voice capture

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **ExternalMedia Channel Mapping Issue (CRITICAL)**
**Problem**: ExternalMedia channel mapping logic looks in `caller_channels` but data is stored in `active_calls`
**Impact**: ExternalMedia channel cannot find its caller, bridge addition fails
**Evidence**: `"ExternalMedia channel entered Stasis but no caller found"`
**Root Cause**: Data structure mismatch in mapping logic

### 2. **Missing Bridge Addition**
**Problem**: ExternalMedia channel never added to bridge
**Impact**: No audio path between caller and ExternalMedia channel
**Evidence**: No bridge addition logs found
**Root Cause**: Mapping failure prevents bridge addition

### 3. **No Provider Session**
**Problem**: Provider session never started
**Impact**: No greeting played, no voice capture
**Evidence**: No TTS or provider logs found
**Root Cause**: Bridge addition failure prevents provider session

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue #1: Data Structure Mismatch (CRITICAL)
**Current**: ExternalMedia handler looks in `caller_channels` for mapping
**Required**: Should look in `active_calls` where the data is actually stored
**Impact**: ExternalMedia channels cannot find their caller channels

### Issue #2: Missing Bridge Addition
**Current**: ExternalMedia channel not added to bridge
**Required**: Add ExternalMedia channel to bridge after successful mapping
**Impact**: No audio path between caller and ExternalMedia

### Issue #3: No Provider Session
**Current**: Provider session never started
**Required**: Start provider session after successful bridge addition
**Impact**: No greeting, no voice capture

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix #1: Correct Data Structure Mapping (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: ExternalMedia handler uses wrong data structure
**Solution**: Change mapping logic to use `active_calls` instead of `caller_channels`
```python
# Current (WRONG):
for channel_id, call_data in self.caller_channels.items():

# Fixed (CORRECT):
for channel_id, call_data in self.active_calls.items():
```

### Fix #2: Verify Bridge Addition
**Problem**: ExternalMedia channel not added to bridge
**Solution**: Ensure bridge addition happens after successful mapping

### Fix #3: Start Provider Session
**Problem**: Provider session never started
**Solution**: Start provider session after successful bridge addition

## Confidence Score: 9/10

The issue is clearly identified - data structure mismatch in the ExternalMedia channel mapping logic. The fix is straightforward and should resolve the problem completely.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix data structure mapping** - Change `caller_channels` to `active_calls` in ExternalMedia handler
2. **Test bridge addition** - Verify ExternalMedia channel is added to bridge
3. **Test provider session** - Verify greeting plays and voice capture works
4. **Test complete flow** - Verify end-to-end ExternalMedia functionality

```

**Status**: ‚ùå **FAILURE** - No AudioSocket connection available for voice capture (404 error prevented connection)

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **AudioSocket ARI Command 404 Error (CRITICAL)**
**Problem**: ARI execute_application returns 404 error for AudioSocket command
**Impact**: No AudioSocket connection established, no voice capture possible
**Evidence**: `{"status": 404, "reason": "{\"message\":\"Resource not found\"}"}`
**Root Cause**: AudioSocket is not supported via ARI execute_application in Asterisk 16

### 2. **Garbled Greeting Audio (NEW ISSUE)**
**Problem**: Greeting plays but sounds distorted/garbled
**Impact**: Poor user experience, unclear what's being said
**Evidence**: User reported "garbled initial greeting"
**Possible Cause**: Audio format mismatch or codec issue

### 3. **Missing AudioSocket Connection Mapping**
**Problem**: No connection ID available for voice capture after greeting
**Impact**: Voice capture cannot be enabled
**Evidence**: `"üé§ AUDIO CAPTURE - No connection found for channel"`

### 4. **‚úÖ TTS Generation Working**
**Problem**: Previously broken, now fixed
**Impact**: Greeting audio generated successfully
**Evidence**: `"TTS response received and delivered"` + 13,003 bytes generated

### 5. **‚úÖ ARI File Playback Working**
**Problem**: Previously broken, now working
**Impact**: Audio plays to caller successfully
**Evidence**: `"Audio playback initiated successfully"` + `"Initial greeting played via ARI"`

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue #1: AudioSocket ARI Command 404 Error (CRITICAL)
**Current**: `execute_application` returns 404 for AudioSocket command
**Required**: Use dialplan approach instead of ARI command (AudioSocket not supported via ARI)

### Issue #2: Garbled Greeting Audio (NEW - HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current**: Greeting plays but sounds distorted
**Required**: Investigate audio format/codec mismatch causing distortion

### Issue #3: Missing AudioSocket Connection Mapping
**Current**: No connection ID available for voice capture
**Required**: Establish AudioSocket connection via dialplan and map to channel

### Issue #4: ‚úÖ TTS Generation Fixed
**Current**: Working correctly
**Required**: No action needed

### Issue #5: ‚úÖ ARI File Playback Fixed
**Current**: Working correctly
**Required**: No action needed

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix #1: Implement Dialplan AudioSocket Approach (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: ARI execute_application returns 404 for AudioSocket
**Solution**: Use dialplan approach - originate Local channel directly to AudioSocket context
```asterisk
[ai-audiosocket-only]
exten => _[0-9a-fA-F].,1,NoOp(AudioSocket for ${EXTEN})
 same => n,Answer()
 same => n,AudioSocket(${EXTEN},127.0.0.1:8090)
 same => n,Hangup()
```

### Fix #2: Investigate Garbled Audio (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Greeting plays but sounds distorted
**Solution**: Check audio format/codec compatibility between TTS output and Asterisk playback

### Fix #3: Verify AudioSocket Connection Mapping
**Problem**: No connection established for voice capture
**Solution**: Ensure AudioSocket connection is properly mapped to channel after dialplan approach

### Fix #4: Test Complete Two-Way Audio
**Problem**: Only outbound audio working
**Solution**: Verify inbound audio capture and processing after AudioSocket fix

### Fix #5: ‚úÖ TTS and Playback Working
**Status**: No action needed - working correctly

## Confidence Score: 8/10

The analysis shows that the major infrastructure is working (TTS, ARI playback, Stasis, Bridge) but two critical issues remain: AudioSocket connection establishment failing due to ARI command 404 error, and garbled greeting audio. The solution is to use dialplan approach instead of ARI execute_application.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix AudioSocket connection** - Use dialplan approach instead of ARI command
2. **Investigate garbled audio** - Check audio format/codec compatibility
3. **Test voice capture** - Verify AudioSocket connection and voice processing
4. **Test complete two-way audio** - Verify end-to-end conversation flow
5. **‚úÖ TTS and playback working** - No action needed
