# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Single Container Architecture with Configuration Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a unified single-container architecture that consolidates all AI components and implements the configuration-driven system specified in the PRD
# Details:
Refactor the current multi-service Docker architecture into a single container as specified in the PRD. Create the src/engine module as the main entry point. Implement the yaml-based configuration system (ai-agent.yaml) with support for local, cloud, and hybrid AI modes. Create configuration templates for different AI engine flavors (local.yaml, cloud.yaml, hybrid.yaml, custom.yaml). Integrate the existing shared/config.py with the new yaml-based configuration structure. Ensure the container can switch between AI providers based on configuration without code changes.

# Test Strategy:
Test configuration loading for all AI engine modes. Verify single container can start successfully. Test switching between different configuration files. Validate all environment variables are properly mapped to the new configuration system.
