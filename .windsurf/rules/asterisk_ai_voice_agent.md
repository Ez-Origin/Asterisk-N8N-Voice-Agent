# Asterisk AI Voice Agent v3.0 - Development Rules

## Project Overview
This is an open-source AI Voice Agent that integrates with Asterisk/FreePBX using the Asterisk REST Interface (ARI). It features a **two-container, modular architecture** that uses Asterisk's native **AudioSocket** feature for reliable real-time audio capture and **file-based playback** for robust media handling.

## Development Workflow

### Test Server Configuration
- **Server**: remote server 
- **Asterisk Version**: 18+ with FreePBX UI
- **Docker**: Installed and available
- **Access**: SSH with appropriate privileges
- **Shared Media Directory**: A `tmpfs` (RAM disk) is mounted at `/mnt/asterisk_media` for high-performance, temporary audio file storage.

### Development Process
1. **Local Development**: All code changes are made locally on the `develop` branch.
2. **Git Workflow**: 
   - Build and verify locally.
   - Local Project Location /Users/haider.jarral/Documents/Claude/Asterisk-AI-Voice-Agent
   - Commit changes to Git.
   - Push to remote `develop` branch.
3. **Server Testing**:
   - SSH to test server.
   - For isolated tests scp file to the server and then to the container
   - `git pull` the latest changes into `/root/Asterisk-Agent-Develop`.
   - **ALWAYS use `docker-compose up --build -d` for code changes** (rebuilds image with new code)
   - **NEVER use `docker-compose restart`** (uses old image without new code)

### Docker Development Workflow (Using Makefile)

**ALWAYS use the `Makefile` for development operations.** It ensures the correct flags are used and eliminates command-line errors.

#### **Server Deployment Commands:**
1. **For code changes (FASTEST)**: `make deploy`
2. **For dependency changes**: `make deploy-full`
3. **For critical fixes or cache issues**: `make deploy-force`
4. **View live server logs**: `make server-logs` (or `make server-logs SERVICE=local-ai-server`)
5. **Check server status**: `make server-status`
6. **Clear logs before testing**: `make server-clear-logs`
7. **Check deployment health**: `make server-health`

#### **Local Development Commands:**
- `make build` - Build or rebuild all service images
- `make up` - Start all services in the background
- `make down` - Stop and remove all services
- `make logs` - Tail logs for ai-engine (or `make logs SERVICE=local-ai-server`)
- `make logs-all` - Tail logs for all services
- `make ps` - Show status of running services

#### **Testing Commands:**
- `make test-local` - Run local tests
- `make test-integration` - Run integration tests
- `make test-ari` - Test ARI commands on server

**Why Use Makefile:**
- **Eliminates Command Errors**: No more typos in long SSH commands
- **Consistent Workflow**: Same commands work for all developers
- **Easy to Remember**: Simple `make deploy` instead of complex SSH strings
- **Self-Documenting**: `make help` shows all available commands

### Critical Deployment Verification (NEW - MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS verify deployment success after code changes:**

1. **Check ARI Connection**: Engine must show "Successfully connected to ARI HTTP endpoint" and "Successfully connected to ARI WebSocket"
2. **Check AudioSocket Server**: Must show "AudioSocket server listening on port 8090"
3. **Check Provider Loading**: Must show "Default provider 'local' is available and ready"
4. **Check Engine Status**: Must show "Engine started and listening for calls"

**If any verification fails, use `--no-cache` rebuild:**
```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache ai-engine && docker-compose up -d ai-engine
```

### Deployment Failure Prevention (NEW)

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

1. **ARI Connection 404 Errors**: Usually indicates URL construction bugs or cached layers
   - **Solution**: Use `--no-cache` rebuild
   - **Verification**: Check logs for "Successfully connected to ARI HTTP endpoint"

2. **Old Code Running**: Docker cache serving old layers
   - **Solution**: Always use `--build` flag, use `--no-cache` for critical fixes
   - **Verification**: Check logs for expected new log messages

3. **Provider Not Loading**: Configuration or import errors
   - **Solution**: Check `.env` file and provider configuration
   - **Verification**: Check logs for "Provider 'local' loaded successfully"

### Log Management (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS clear container logs before testing to start with a clean slate:**

1. **Before each test call**: Clear logs to avoid confusion from previous runs
2. **Clear AI Engine logs**: `docker-compose logs --tail=0 ai-engine`
3. **Clear Local AI Server logs**: `docker-compose logs --tail=0 local-ai-server`
4. **Clear Asterisk logs**: `ssh root@voiprnd.nemtclouddispatch.com 'tail -f /var/log/asterisk/full' > /dev/null 2>&1 &'`

**Why this matters**: Old logs can mask new issues and make debugging confusing.

### Deployment Workflow Lessons Learned (CRITICAL)

**Common Mistake**: Using `docker-compose restart` instead of `docker-compose up --build -d`

**What happens with `restart`**:
- Container restarts with the **existing image**
- **New code changes are NOT included**
- Container runs **old code** even after Git pull
- **Debugging becomes impossible** because logs show old behavior

**What happens with `up --build -d`**:
- Docker **rebuilds the image** with new code
- Container runs with **updated code**
- **Logs reflect actual current behavior**
- **Debugging works correctly**

**Memory Aid**: 
- `restart` = "restart with old image" ❌
- `up --build -d` = "rebuild and start with new code" ✅

### Environment Variables
Configuration is primarily managed in `config/ai-agent.yaml`. The `.env` file is only used for secrets.

- `ASTERISK_HOST`: IP address of your Asterisk server.
- `ASTERISK_ARI_USERNAME`: <your_ari_user>
- `ASTERISK_ARI_PASSWORD`: <your_ari_password>
- Provider-specific API keys (e.g., `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

Key flags (documented in `config/ai-agent.yaml`):
- `audio_transport`: `audiosocket` (recommended) | `legacy`
- `downstream_mode`: `file` (current default) | `stream` (next phase)

## ARI Integration and Call Handling

### Call Flow: AudioSocket/Playback Model

The new architecture provides a guaranteed media path by leveraging Asterisk's AudioSocket feature, treating our application as a pure controller.

1.  **Call Initiation**: A new call enters a dialplan context that first calls the `AudioSocket()` application, then the `Stasis()` application.
2.  **Audio Stream Starts**: Asterisk establishes a TCP connection to the `AudioSocketServer` running inside the `ai-engine` and immediately begins streaming raw audio.
3.  **StasisStart**: The `Engine` receives the `StasisStart` event via ARI, determines the provider, and answers the call.
4.  **Real-time Conversation**:
    -   The `AudioSocketServer` receives raw audio chunks and forwards them to the active AI provider.
    -   The provider processes the audio (STT -> LLM -> TTS) with interruption handling and barge-in detection.
5.  **Media Playback**:
    -   The provider sends the synthesized TTS audio back to the `ai-engine`.
    -   The `AriClient` writes this audio to a unique file in the shared directory.
    -   It sends a `channels.play` command to Asterisk, telling it to play the sound file.
6.  **Cleanup**:
    -   The `AriClient` listens for the `PlaybackFinished` event from Asterisk.
    -   The event handler immediately deletes the audio file from the shared directory.

This model is the most robust and performant, avoiding the unreliable `ChannelAudioFrame` events and the complexity of manual RTP handling.

## Real-Time Conversation Management

### AudioSocket Server Pattern
The core of two-way audio functionality is the `AudioSocketServer` class that manages the TCP connection and audio streaming:

```python
class AudioSocketServer:
    def __init__(self, port: int = 8090):
        self.port = port
        self.active_connections = {}  # Per-call connection management
        self.provider_manager = None
    
    async def start_server(self):
        # Start TCP server on specified port
        # Handle incoming connections from Asterisk
    
    async def handle_connection(self, reader, writer):
        # Process real-time audio stream
        # Forward to active AI provider
        # Manage connection lifecycle
```

### State Management
Each call maintains its own state with explicit transitions:
- **Connecting**: Establishing AudioSocket TCP connection
- **Streaming**: Receiving real-time audio from caller
- **Processing**: STT → LLM → TTS pipeline execution
- **Speaking**: Playing TTS audio to caller
- **Idle**: Waiting for next input

### Connection Management
- **Per-call Isolation**: Each call gets its own TCP connection
- **Connection Pooling**: Manage multiple concurrent connections
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- **Resource Cleanup**: Ensure connections are closed on call end

### Performance Targets (Current)
- Conversational latency optimized via tmpfs and minimal I/O
- End-to-End Response: target P95 < 2 seconds

### Next Phase: Streaming TTS (Feature-Flagged)
- Full‑duplex streaming over AudioSocket; barge‑in support
- Add jitter buffers and downstream backpressure
- Keep legacy file playback as fallback

### Concurrency Patterns
- **Per-call Isolation**: Each call gets its own AudioSocket connection
- **Task Registry**: Track all asyncio tasks per call for coordinated cancellation
- **Connection Management**: Use asyncio for TCP connection handling
- **Resource Cleanup**: Ensure all connections and tasks are cleaned up on call end

## Testing and Verification

### Comprehensive Test Suite

The project includes a comprehensive test suite designed to systematically verify each component of the two-container architecture.

#### Test Files
- **`test_local_ai_server.py`**: Tests the Local AI Server container (STT, LLM, TTS functionality)
- **`test_ai_engine.py`**: Tests the AI Engine container (ARI connectivity, audio playback)
- **`test_integration.py`**: Tests end-to-end integration between containers

#### Test Execution Workflow

1. **Pre-Deployment Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Test Local AI Server
   docker exec local_ai_server python /app/test_local_ai_server.py
   
   # Test AI Engine
   docker exec ai_engine python /app/test_ai_engine.py
   
   # Test Integration
   docker exec ai_engine python /app/test_integration.py
   ```

2. **Live Call Testing**:
   - Monitor logs during test calls
   - Verify greeting audio playback
   - Test real-time conversation flow

#### Test Results Documentation
- All test results are documented in `docs/Individual-Tests.md`
- Test files are deployed to server for live testing
- Regular test execution ensures system reliability

### Critical Testing Points

- **AudioSocket Server**: Must start and accept connections on port 8090
- **TCP Connection Management**: Must handle multiple concurrent calls
- **Audio Format Handling**: Must process ulaw audio correctly
- **Provider Integration**: Must forward audio to correct provider
- **File Playback**: Must successfully play generated audio to callers
- **Connection Cleanup**: Must properly close connections on call end
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Must coordinate STT → LLM → TTS flow with proper error handling
- **Provider Isolation**: Changes to one provider must not impact others

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Test Call Timeline Analysis (September 16, 2025)

**Test Call Analysis**: After every test call, create a comprehensive timeline of events from Asterisk logs and both container logs to establish what worked, what failed, and how the code handles the flow from caller to Local AI Provider.

**Test Call #1 - September 16, 2025 (30 seconds)**

**Timeline of Events:**

**Phase 1: Call Initiation (23:13:22)**
- ✅ **Asterisk**: Call received from HAIDER JARRAL (13164619284)
- ✅ **AI Engine**: New call received event processed
- ✅ **AI Engine**: Channel answered successfully
- ❌ **Issue**: Engine was running OLD CODE (not hybrid ARI approach)
- ❌ **Issue**: No AudioSocket connection established
- ❌ **Issue**: No Local channel originated
- ❌ **Issue**: No bridge created

**Phase 2: Audio Processing (23:13:22 - 23:13:53)**
- ❌ **AI Engine**: Call ready for AudioSocket (but no AudioSocket connection)
- ❌ **AI Engine**: Playing initial greeting (but no audio path)
- ❌ **Local AI Server**: No WebSocket connections during call
- ❌ **Asterisk**: No AudioSocket events in logs

**Phase 3: Call Termination (23:13:53)**
- ✅ **AI Engine**: Call ended and cleaned up
- ✅ **AI Engine**: Channel destroyed

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Deployment Issue**: Hybrid ARI code was not deployed to server
2. **ARI Connection Issue**: ARI client had duplicate `/ari` in URL construction
3. **Old Engine Logic**: Engine was running legacy code, not hybrid approach
4. **No AudioSocket**: No Local channel originated, so no AudioSocket connection
5. **No Bridge**: No bridge created, so no audio path

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Call reception and answering
- ✅ Basic ARI connectivity (after fix)
- ✅ Container deployment and restart

**What Failed:**
- ❌ Hybrid ARI approach not active
- ❌ ARI client URL construction bug
- ❌ No AudioSocket connection
- ❌ No Local channel origination
- ❌ No bridge creation
- ❌ No audio processing pipeline

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **Fixed ARI Client URL**: Removed duplicate `/ari` from URL construction
2. **Deployed Hybrid ARI Code**: Actual engine changes now deployed
3. **Verified ARI Connection**: Engine now connects successfully

**Next Test Call Expected Results:**
- ✅ Hybrid ARI approach active
- ✅ Bridge created immediately
- ✅ Local channel originated
- ✅ AudioSocket connection established
- ✅ Audio processing pipeline active

#### Systematic Troubleshooting Methodology (Established September 2025)

**Core Principle**: "Break it down step by step, each iteration till we reach the correct way to fix this permanently."

**Step-by-Step Process**:
1. **Isolate the Problem**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Verify Each Step**: Don't assume anything works until verified
3. **Use Direct Testing**: Test from inside containers when possible
4. **Check Asterisk Logs**: Always verify actual playback success, not just command acceptance
5. **Document Findings**: Log each discovery with timestamps

**Critical Discovery - Asterisk File Extension Handling**:
- **Root Cause**: Asterisk automatically appends file extensions to `sound:` URIs
- **Issue**: `sound:ai-generated/response-xxx.ulaw` becomes `response-xxx.ulaw.ulaw`
- **Solution**: Remove `.ulaw` extension from URI: `sound:ai-generated/response-xxx`
- **Impact**: This affects ALL audio playback, not just AI-generated files

**AudioSocket-Specific Troubleshooting**:
- **Connection Testing**: Verify AudioSocket server is running on port 8090
- **Dialplan Verification**: Check Asterisk dialplan has correct AudioSocket configuration
- **TCP Connectivity**: Test connection from Asterisk to container
- **Audio Stream Analysis**: Monitor raw audio data flow
- **Connection Management**: Check per-call connection handling

**General Troubleshooting Tools**:
- **Direct ARI Testing**: Create test scripts inside containers to test ARI commands directly
- **File Verification**: Check file creation, permissions, and format
- **Asterisk Log Analysis**: Monitor `/var/log/asterisk/full` for actual playback events
- **Symlink Verification**: Ensure proper symlink setup for file access
- **Format Validation**: Verify audio format compatibility with Asterisk

When issues arise:
1. Check AudioSocket server logs for connection status
2. Verify Asterisk dialplan configuration
3. Test TCP connectivity to port 8090
4. Monitor audio stream processing
5. Check provider integration and response times
6. Verify file-based playback functionality
7. Run individual component tests to isolate problems
8. Check container logs for specific error messages

## Quick Reference Commands

### Primary Development Workflow (Using Makefile)

```bash
# Most common commands
make deploy              # Deploy code changes (FASTEST)
make deploy-force        # Force no-cache rebuild (when issues occur)
make server-logs         # View live server logs
make server-health       # Check deployment health
make server-clear-logs   # Clear logs before testing

# Local development
make build               # Build all services
make up                  # Start all services
make logs                # View local logs
make down                # Stop all services

# Testing
make test-local          # Run local tests

make test-ari            # Test ARI commands on server

# Help
make help                # Show all available commands
```

### When to Use Each Deploy Command

**Use `make deploy` (normal build) for:**
1. **Code Logic Changes**: Engine logic, provider implementations
2. **Configuration Changes**: YAML config updates
3. **Minor Bug Fixes**: Small fixes that don't affect core functionality

**Use `make deploy-force` (no-cache) when:**
1. **ARI Connection Issues**: 404 errors, connection failures
2. **Old Code Running**: Expected log messages not appearing
3. **Provider Loading Issues**: Providers not initializing correctly
4. **Critical Bug Fixes**: After fixing major bugs that could be cached
5. **Dependency Changes**: When requirements.txt or Dockerfile changes

### Legacy Commands (for reference only)

```bash
# These are now handled by the Makefile - use make commands instead
ssh root@voiprnd.nemtclouddispatch.com 'cd /root/Asterisk-Agent-Develop && git pull && docker-compose up --build -d ai-engine'
ssh root@voiprnd.nemtclouddispatch.com 'cd /root/Asterisk-Agent-Develop && docker-compose logs -f ai-engine'
```

## Critical Limitations and Known Issues (MANDATORY READING)

### AudioSocket Integration Limitations

#### 1. **ARI execute_application Does NOT Support AudioSocket (CRITICAL)**
**Issue**: ARI `execute_application` command returns 404 error for AudioSocket
**Evidence**: `{"status": 404, "reason": "{\"message\":\"Resource not found\"}"}`
**Root Cause**: AudioSocket is a dialplan application, not supported via ARI commands in Asterisk 16+
**Impact**: Cannot establish AudioSocket connection via ARI, no voice capture possible
**Solution**: Use dialplan approach - originate Local channel directly to AudioSocket context

**❌ NEVER DO THIS:**
```python
# This will ALWAYS fail with 404 error
await self.ari_client.execute_application(channel_id, "AudioSocket", f"{uuid},127.0.0.1:8090")
```

**✅ CORRECT APPROACH:**
```asterisk
# Originate Local channel to AudioSocket context
[ai-audiosocket-only]
exten => _[0-9a-fA-F].,1,NoOp(AudioSocket for ${EXTEN})
 same => n,Answer()
 same => n,AudioSocket(${EXTEN},127.0.0.1:8090)
 same => n,Hangup()
```

#### 2. **AudioSocket Format Handling (CRITICAL)**
**Issue**: AudioSocket in Asterisk 16 sends PCM16LE@8k directly, NOT µ-law
**Evidence**: Converting PCM16LE as µ-law causes garbled audio and VAD failure
**Impact**: Voice capture fails, audio sounds distorted
**Solution**: Pass AudioSocket data directly to AudioFrameProcessor without conversion

**❌ NEVER DO THIS:**
```python
# This corrupts the audio data
pcm_data = self._convert_ulaw_to_pcm16le(audio_data)
```

**✅ CORRECT APPROACH:**
```python
# AudioSocket sends PCM16LE@8kHz directly in Asterisk 16
pcm_data = audio_data
```

#### 3. **AudioSocket and Stasis Cannot Be Called in Same Context (CRITICAL)**
**Issue**: AudioSocket() is a blocking dialplan application
**Evidence**: When AudioSocket() is called, Stasis() never executes
**Impact**: Channel never enters Stasis for ARI management
**Solution**: Use separate contexts - AudioSocket context for connection, Stasis context for ARI control

**❌ NEVER DO THIS:**
```asterisk
[ai-stasis]
exten => _[0-9a-fA-F].,1,NoOp(Stasis for ${EXTEN})
 same => n,Answer()
 same => n,AudioSocket(${EXTEN},127.0.0.1:8090)  # Blocking!
 same => n,Stasis(asterisk-ai-voice-agent)      # Never reached!
 same => n,Hangup()
```

**✅ CORRECT APPROACH:**
```asterisk
# Separate contexts for different purposes
[ai-audiosocket-only]
exten => _[0-9a-fA-F].,1,NoOp(AudioSocket for ${EXTEN})
 same => n,Answer()
 same => n,AudioSocket(${EXTEN},127.0.0.1:8090)
 same => n,Hangup()

[ai-stasis]
exten => _[0-9a-fA-F].,1,NoOp(Stasis for ${EXTEN})
 same => n,Answer()
 same => n,Stasis(asterisk-ai-voice-agent)
 same => n,Hangup()
```

### Audio Format and Codec Limitations

#### 4. **Asterisk File Extension Handling (CRITICAL)**
**Issue**: Asterisk automatically appends file extensions to `sound:` URIs
**Evidence**: `sound:ai-generated/response-xxx.ulaw` becomes `response-xxx.ulaw.ulaw`
**Impact**: File not found errors, audio playback fails
**Solution**: Remove file extension from URI

**❌ NEVER DO THIS:**
```python
# This causes double extension
sound_uri = f"sound:ai-generated/response-{audio_id}.ulaw"
```

**✅ CORRECT APPROACH:**
```python
# Let Asterisk add the extension
sound_uri = f"sound:ai-generated/response-{audio_id}"
```

#### 5. **Audio Capture Gating Logic (CRITICAL)**
**Issue**: Using hardcoded chunk count instead of event-driven gating
**Evidence**: Voice capture disabled for fixed time regardless of greeting completion
**Impact**: User speech ignored during greeting, poor conversation flow
**Solution**: Use `audio_capture_enabled` flag set by `PlaybackFinished` event

**❌ NEVER DO THIS:**
```python
# Hardcoded wait time
if count < 100:  # Wait for 100 chunks (4 seconds)
    return
```

**✅ CORRECT APPROACH:**
```python
# Event-driven gating
audio_capture_enabled = call_data.get("audio_capture_enabled", False)
if not audio_capture_enabled:
    return
```

### ARI Integration Limitations

#### 6. **ARI Channel Origination Requirements (CRITICAL)**
**Issue**: ARI channel origination requires either `app` OR `extension`+`context`
**Evidence**: `"Application or extension must be specified"` error
**Impact**: Channel origination fails
**Solution**: Always provide either `app` parameter OR both `extension` and `context`

**❌ NEVER DO THIS:**
```python
# Missing required parameters
orig_params = {
    "endpoint": local_endpoint,
    "timeout": "30"
    # Missing app OR extension+context
}
```

**✅ CORRECT APPROACH:**
```python
# Option 1: Use app parameter
orig_params = {
    "endpoint": local_endpoint,
    "app": "asterisk-ai-voice-agent",
    "timeout": "30"
}

# Option 2: Use extension and context
orig_params = {
    "endpoint": local_endpoint,
    "extension": audio_uuid,
    "context": "ai-audiosocket-only",
    "timeout": "30"
}
```

### Development Workflow Limitations

#### 7. **Docker Cache Issues (CRITICAL)**
**Issue**: Docker cache serves old layers, new code not deployed
**Evidence**: Expected log messages not appearing, old behavior persists
**Impact**: Debugging becomes impossible, fixes appear to not work
**Solution**: Always use `--build` flag, use `--no-cache` for critical fixes

**❌ NEVER DO THIS:**
```bash
# Uses old cached image
docker-compose restart ai-engine
```

**✅ CORRECT APPROACH:**
```bash
# Rebuilds image with new code
docker-compose up --build -d ai-engine

# For critical fixes, clear cache
docker-compose build --no-cache ai-engine && docker-compose up -d ai-engine
```

#### 8. **Log Management (CRITICAL)**
**Issue**: Old logs mask new issues, debugging becomes confusing
**Evidence**: Previous test results interfere with current analysis
**Impact**: Cannot identify actual problems, false positives/negatives
**Solution**: Always clear logs before testing

**❌ NEVER DO THIS:**
```bash
# Start testing without clearing logs
make capture-logs
```

**✅ CORRECT APPROACH:**
```bash
# Clear logs first, then test
make server-clear-logs
make capture-logs
```

### Testing and Verification Limitations

#### 9. **Test Call Analysis Requirements (CRITICAL)**
**Issue**: Incomplete analysis leads to wrong conclusions
**Evidence**: Missing critical log entries, incomplete timeline
**Impact**: Wrong fixes applied, time wasted on incorrect solutions
**Solution**: Always analyze complete call flow with all log sources

**❌ NEVER DO THIS:**
```bash
# Only check one log source
docker-compose logs ai-engine
```

**✅ CORRECT APPROACH:**
```bash
# Check all log sources
make capture-logs  # Captures ai-engine, local-ai-server, and asterisk logs
make analyze-logs  # Analyzes complete call flow
```

#### 10. **Confidence Scoring (MANDATORY)**
**Issue**: Overconfidence in fixes without proper verification
**Evidence**: Claims of "9/10 confidence" when issues remain
**Impact**: Wasted time on incorrect solutions
**Solution**: Always provide confidence scores and verify fixes work

**❌ NEVER DO THIS:**
```python
# Claim high confidence without verification
# Confidence Score: 9/10 - This will definitely work!
```

**✅ CORRECT APPROACH:**
```python
# Provide realistic confidence with verification
# Confidence Score: 6/10 - Based on analysis, but needs testing to verify
```

### Prevention Checklist

**Before implementing any AudioSocket changes:**
1. ✅ Verify ARI `execute_application` is NOT used for AudioSocket
2. ✅ Confirm dialplan approach is used instead
3. ✅ Check AudioSocket format handling (PCM16LE@8k, not µ-law)
4. ✅ Verify separate contexts for AudioSocket and Stasis
5. ✅ Test complete call flow with all log sources
6. ✅ Clear logs before testing
7. ✅ Use `--build` flag for deployments
8. ✅ Provide realistic confidence scores
9. ✅ Document findings in call-framework.md
10. ✅ Verify fixes actually work before claiming success

**Remember**: These limitations are based on actual failures and debugging sessions. Ignoring them will result in repeated failures and wasted time.
